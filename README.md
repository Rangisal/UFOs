# UFOs Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
More in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date,filters have been created for the city, state, country, and shape.
The filter table has been built using data stored in a JavaScript array and the filters have been used this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
Also the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualization. 

## Results

As per the below image the users can see the head of the webpage when it is opened.This will include brief summary of the data as well.

Further if a user wants to find more information the data filters can be used to get the desired output.The user can simply use the filter table and can pick any of the filters options including date, city, state, country and shape or multiple options also can be used to filter the relevant data. The HTML page will display the specific data once finished the filtering process as follows.

## Summary

### The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage
- It is noted that we need more information to get the fully understanding of the UFO sightings.Eventhough the data consists with the date and duration , it is important to have the information on time as well. Hence we can calcuate on average the time period of UFO sightings most likely to be happened.

### The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development.
- It will be very useful if the date option of the filter search can be set up as a range instead of one date , for example from date - to date as if a user wants to know how many sightings happened in a month it will be easier to see the output rather than entering one date at a time. 
- Also if we can use API to trace the locations of the previously sighting occured and redevelop with the frequency of each location will give more interesting information to the user.
